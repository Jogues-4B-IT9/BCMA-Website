<h2 class="prob"><u>Problem Statement</u> </h2><br>
<p>
The Badjao community of Matina Aplaya are being threatened by the evergrowing problem that is waste pollution, trash and other types of waste could be seen scattered around within their community and coastlines raising health and environmental risks among its residents and their livelihoods and endangering the community and threatening the world itself. Improper waste disposal, segregation and marine debris ending up in the coastline and inside their community are one of the main causes that feed this problems growth. As opposed to maintaining and living in a clean living environment, these people have to suffer living in constant danger through their environment being littered with trash despite them not knowing or giving too much thought about its effects on them and the environment as a whole

<img src ="Hightide.jpeg" id="othersides"><br>
<div id="bakery">
<h2 class="prob"><u> Problem Description </u></h2><br>
<p>Since their community is situated in an area often affected by high tide flooding, this often brings waste and other marine debris from the coast and ocean inside the community whenever low tide occurs. Naturally, because of the trash scattered around, health risks also tend to rise which makes it harder to maintain their health. Improper waste disposal and segregation also negatively promotes the growth of occupied waste piles, greenhouse gas effects as well as endangering marine organisms and wildlife, to which also endangers their livelihood of fishing. We want the Badjao community to not have to succumb to such living conditions, so we wish to help the Badjao community have a cleaner and safe environment for them to live in. This community is their home, and especially with their current conditions, they need to feel genuine safety and cleanliness in their own dwellings and neighbrohood.</p>

<h2 class="prob"> <u>Proposed Project </u></h2><br>
</p>
the intervention that our group intends to propose is helping the badjao community in doing proper waste disposal through participating and carrying out a clean up program, the 30k G! project, that is flex continue on monthly that not only helps in cleaning around the neighbourhood and coastline but provides segregation materials like trash bags that will help in segregating their waste to improve waste management in addition to teaching and guiding them on its importance and basics. The significance of this intervention is to help the badjao community to be a better place for its inhabitants, secure health safety in their physical states and help in maintaining environmental protection and rehabilitation, doing all of this can help improve the state of their community along with becoming a better example for other communities not only to the Badjao but to every community.

<p>
Their community has always faced this problem of improper waste disposal, segregation and high tide flooding seeing as how it has existed for a very long time and its effects could still be seen present and occuring within their area. According to Toolkit.Climate.Gov, high tide flooding causes major inconvenience to community streets and area's which is further proved by the Badjao communities experiences as these occurences have brought trash from the coasts and oceans INSIDE their community area's. Furthermore, paired with improper waste disposal accompanied by inevitable improper segregation more and more trash accumulates within their community, thus expands the <br><br>

<img src="fishie.jpg" class="imgdivB"><br><br>
amount of risks that the residents are exposed to, namely disease and possible loss of income. Water pollution which comes with high tide flooding also provides a great threat as according to Inquirer.net, about 6,000 deaths annually are blamed on the country’s water pollution (Lasco, 2022). In relation to our partner institution, water pollution also has a significant effect on fishing as harmful chemicals are often released when plastics interact with water which would affect the livelihood of their community (PubMed, n.d.). Solving this problem promotes and brings us closer to reaching our goal as an organization which is to improve the livelihood of the partner institution through cleaning their environment and making sure that water pollution and improper waste disposal will not affect their daily lives and ensure that their safety and clean environment in their community is secure.

<a name="OurSol"><h1> Our Solution </h1><br>
This project hopes to improve the lifestyles of the Badjao Community of Matina Aplaya Inc. Through our efforts of our clean drive implementation and information propagation on waste disposal management and segregation, we hope to be able to make our partner institution's community be safer and cleaner for them to live in. We will collect trash that litters the local area of our community. We aim to collect 30 kg of allotted trash of the Badjao community,
 meaning an estimate of 30 bags of sacks of waste lessened in the area. We also aim to teach Badjao in the community how to manage their trash with the infographics we’ve created and implement segregation bins for people to manage their trash (Recyclables, Biodigrables, Non-biodegradables) in convenient areas of their community in order to 
 lessen land pollution. We will also be providing them segregation materials that can greatly help them in organizing or segregating their wastes and turning their community into a cleaner and safer place.

<div class="Signif">
<b class="dif">Why is the project important for the partner institution?</b><br><br>

This project can greatly help our partner institution attain more knowledge about the importance of segregating and disposing their wastes properly, in this way we are able to help them be self sufficient in handling waste in the future. Whilst conducting clean up drives would be able to greatly help clean their community and let them learn more about proper waste management and disposal. <br><br>


<b class="dif">Why is the project important for the Ateneo students?</b><br><br>

The project is important because it teaches fellow Ateneo Students important life lessons to implement into their daily lives specifically in waste management. Through our project proposal our actions and such can be examples of how to help and teach others whilst raising awareness of serious issues that plague the community in negative ways. We are able to teach others how to be a proper Atenean through the actions we are willing to do in helping the community.<br><br>

<b class="dif">Why is the project important for the public in general?</b><br><br>

Our project is significant to the public in general as, despite in small amounts, we are still able to contribute to conservative efforts that aim to reform the current waste littered world. Thus, the implementation of our project would still be able to leave an important impact on their community and to the entire world itself through cleaning and serving as the catalyst of growth in the development of communities geared towards more inclination to better care for the environment. Furthermore, this project is proof that we are there to help others to improve their daily lives.<br><br>

<h1>Rationale </h1><br>

The project is important to ensure that the Badjao Community of Matina Aplaya Inc. is safe and  for community members and to spread an environmental message for the rest of the world.  Through the implementation of our project, we aim to partake in the efforts of saving the environment starting in the communities that are most affected by waste pollution, specifically the Badjao Community of Matina Aplaya Inc and as a group, provide assistance for them in clearing out waste around their community as well as the coasts close to them.
