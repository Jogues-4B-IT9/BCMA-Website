Hello! Welcome to the Badjao Community Profile website. With the hopes of being able to express, address, help and raise awareness on the Badjao communities of Davao, particularly on the Badjao Community Association of Matina Aplaya Inc, we, Group 4-B of 9-Jogues, developed this website so we are able easily convey their state of affairs. In addition to being able to present a project proposal and possible solutions to the problems that they face.

<p>
The Badjao or the “Sea Gypsies” are an ethnic group of people who live along the ocean shores of places such as Mindanao, Borneo, Celebes and Indonesia.
Originally, they lived along the coast through trading belongings and catching fish to sustain and get by in life but these days, they can be seen asking for alms and selling imitation items and other goods whilst some form communities along the coast just like the Badjao Community Association of Matina Aplaya.<br><br>

<h3> General Information </h3><br>
<b class="brue">Institution Name:</b> Badjao Community Association of Matina Aplaya Inc.<br>
<b class="brue">Address:</b> Matina Aplaya, Davao City<br>
<b class="brue">Contact Person/s:</b> Melody Adjari<br>
<b class="brue">Contact Number/s:</b> 0905726413; 09057264137<br><br>

Shown beside is a vicinity map showcasing the location of their community and its distance from the Ateneo de Davao Grade school campus.<br><br>

  Founded by Pastor Felicisimo “Jun” Morales, the Badjao Community of Matina Aplaya Inc, together with Lolita Adjiari, founded the association in hopes of helping and setting an example to the badjao as a model community. However, they too have their own issues that they face for example: when it's high tide, it floods their community up to knee high level water and litters trash from the ocean around their area and would often not be disposed of properly resulting in a community littered with trash. <b class="yellow">This problem is also what we would wish to tackle in our project proposal in the following webpages.</b></p><br>
