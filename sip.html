<div class="intro"><h1 style="text-align: center;"> SIP Introduction </h1><br>In addition to our 30K G! project proposal, we are also conducting an experiment based on compost in order to identify and propose an alternative in dealing with organic waste that the community produces to prevent more waste from being discarded and instead reuse it. The two methods of compost: aerobic compost and anaerobic compost were used in the experiment to identify which one is more effective in providing high quality soil for the residents use whether for personal plants or crops and with its results, we're able to enhance the very growth of their crops. </div>

<p>
<!--What is the value of composting to communities and the environment?-->
<span class="yellow"><b>Composting</b></span> is valuable to communities as well as the environment as it encourages <span class="yellow"><b>eco-friendly measures</b></span>
 to counter waste pollution, specifically organic waste in the community, as well as promote organic fertilizer
 for the residents' plants. To further expound, Composting is the process of speeding up the natural decay of
 organic waste through putting together different types of organic materials such as plant waste <span class="spam"><i>(Leaves,Grass Clippings)</i></span> ,
 food waste<span class="spam"> <i>(Fruits, Vegetables)</i></span> and <span class="spam"><i>many more</i></span>  in order to cultivate an ideal area or space for different microorganisms
 to thrive which produces nutrient rich soil <span class="spam"><i>(Ross, 2018)</i></span>. In our project, we will be focusing on the 2 methods of composting:
<span class="yellow"> <b>aerobic</b></span> <span class="spam"> <i>(Hot)</i></span> and <span class="yellow"><b>anaerobic</b></span> <span class="spam"> <i>(cold)</i></span> composting methods, the difference between you turning and mixing the organic materials to
 generate heat in the former whilst not doing it in the latter. Now, communities are able to make use of composting in order to
 reduce the waste that it produces by recycling the organic waste through composting and instead produce nutrient rich soil that
 is beneficial for the plants and environment around the community which makes it valuable for improving waste management. This is
 why it is important to undertake and explore this research as it determines what method is the most efficient and effective way
 of composting and which produces better quality soil.</p><br>

<!-- How can the specific community or institution your PT group is engaged with, make use or benefit from composting in general, and from your groupâ€™s composting project specifically?-->
<p>
With composting, we're able to spread awareness of our message to help our environment
 be greener and cleaner to the Badjao community through giving them the knowledge and opportunity
 to grow their own plants through UCG and composting. By using biodegradable materials, they are
 able to use their waste as compost and uphold environmentally friendly practices without harming
 the environment around their community. The Badjao community are also able to grow their own resources,
 and with the results of the experiment, we are able to improve the method they use in composting and boost
 the yield of their plants through the nutrient rich soil that composting produces and through this, they will
 be able to ease their food and financial needs through consumption or retailing it. </p><br>

		<th> Problem statement </th>
				<td> Because there are multiple ways of composting, such as anaerobic and aerobic composting.
				We often hesitate to choose either one as we do not know which one is better and much more efficient 
				for us to use in our gardening and composting. Thus, this research was conducted in order to address this
				issue and determine what truly is the best method for composting, by comparing and measuring the growth of a plant,
				in our case, we will be using the  Allium chinense plant and planting it on the soil that each method produces.<br></td>
